[Classic Rock Magazine](https://www.loudersound.com/classic-rock) reviews the Fur in its latest issue. If you don't have time for the full read...we'll summarize:

> "..innate garage-rock swagger. Rich in Redd Kross-recalling melodic sensibility, previously defined as commercial."

We don't know what that means, but we'll take it! Thanks to the legendary British music publication for a nod. Pick up your limited edition CD digipack (with custom art & sticker) (vinyl coming soon) at [Cargo Records UK](https://cargorecordsdirect.co.uk/products/furbaby-the-tight-spaces-furbaby-the-tight-spaces)
